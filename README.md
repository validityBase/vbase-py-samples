## Introduction

vBase APIs and services support provably sound data science and regulatory compliance.
Producers can create auditable provenance records for their digital objects while retaining control and privacy.
Consumers can use 3rd party data and models with the same assurance as their internal artifacts.

The following samples illustrate common solutions built on top of the vBase SDK and services.

## Setup

### Install vbase-py

Install the vBase Python SDK:
```commandline
pip install git+https://github.com/validityBase/vbase-py.git
```

### Configure vBase Access

Please contact vBase for help configuring your environment and to obtain an API key.
An API key provides simple managed access to commitment services
without the need to worry about blockchains and cryptocurrency.

If you have previously configured vBase access, for instance when using the `vbase-py-tools` package,
you can re-use those settings by copying `.env` file to the `vbase-py-samples` folder.
If this is your first time working with vBase, you should configure new settings.

If this is your first time accessing vBase, please install the `vbase-py-tools` package
and follow the setup instructions using the `config_env` script provided in that package. 

Below is a summary of the configuration settings from the resulting `.env` file:

```shell
# Forwarder Configuration
# URL of the production vBase forwarder service.
# Users should not change this value.
VBASE_FORWARDER_URL="https://api.vbase.com/forwarder/"
# User API key for accessing the vBase forwarder service.
# Users should set this value to the API key they received from vBase.
VBASE_API_KEY="USER_VBASE_API_KEY"

# User Private Key
# The private key for making stamps/commitments.
# This key signs and controls all operations -- it must be kept secret.
# vBase will never request this value.
VBASE_COMMITMENT_SERVICE_PRIVATE_KEY="USER_VBASE_COMMITMENT_SERVICE_PRIVATE_KEY"
```
